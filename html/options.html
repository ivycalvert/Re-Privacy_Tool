                        Machine Learning content versus Human
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The data set for this project was small due to the limited development time. This has resulted in the machine learning model
                        not having enough testing data to prove the overall accuracy. However, as a proof of concept example of the proposed
                        output, this extension includes both the ability to adapt to data input from the machine learning model, and the Human
                        generated data that was used for the training purposes of the model. <br>
                        The clear difference between these examples can be seen through the range in the complete (human) and incomplete 
                        (machine learning) results displayed on the popup page of the extension. These can also be seen through a small labeling 
                        system featured in the top left of the main screen. The icon there represents if the input data used was generate by a 
                        human (human silhoutte icon) or a computer (computer screen icon) for clarity. This enables the user to immediately identify
                        and guage the accuracy of the information presented to them.
